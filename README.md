# Java Jagged Array Random Print
Welcome to the Java Jagged Array Random Print repository! This project provides a detailed exploration of arrays, 2D arrays, and jagged arrays in Java, combined with the usage of random numbers.

## Description
This Java project offers a comprehensive demonstration of working with arrays, 2D arrays, and jagged arrays. It specifically focuses on:

1. Arrays: Fundamental data structures in Java that hold elements of the same type.
2. 2D Arrays: Arrays of arrays, where each sub-array has the same length, forming a matrix-like structure.
3. Jagged Arrays: Arrays of arrays where each sub-array can have different lengths, creating a "jagged" structure.
4. Random Number Usage: Generating random integers to fill the arrays, adding variability and demonstrating dynamic data handling.
   
In this example, we initialize a jagged array with three rows of varying lengths (3, 4, and 5 columns respectively). The project includes:

Filling and printing the jagged array using nested for-loops, generating random integers between 0 and 9.
An alternative method using enhanced for-loops to print random numbers directly, showcasing different approaches to handling jagged arrays.
Usage
To explore this project:

### 1. Ensure Java is installed on your system.
### 2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
### 3. Navigate to the directory containing the Java files.
### 4. Compile the Java files using the command:
bash
javac Jagged.java

### 5. Run the compiled program using the command:
bash
java Jagged

Observe the output printed to the console, showcasing the manipulation of arrays, 2D arrays, jagged arrays, and random number generation.
